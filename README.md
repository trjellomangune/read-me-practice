# :syringe: CAREPATH

Carepath is a blockchain enabled infant immunization registry equipped with an SMS reminder system and QR code system. This system can be implemented in different cities here in the Philippines, which until now have used the traditional handling and monitoring of immunization records. This system will improve the traditional handling of immunization records and the monitoring of the vaccination schedule using SMS messaging notification, thereby reducing the risks for infants of having vaccine-preventable diseases and reducing the infantâ€™s morbidity rate. The <i>"path"</i> in the project title <i>"Carepath"</i> underscores the intentional journey towards recognizing blockchain's broader applications beyond cryptocurrency, especially in the realm of healthcare. This project can demonstrate the effectiveness of using blockchain to our healthcare systems and can serve as a mainspring for creating more blockchain based systems and services in the Philippines.
